### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I started my digital journey in eCommerce, where Iâ€™ve picked up the coding skills necessary for my job. Building simple newsletter emails and static pages. Iâ€™ve also gained experience working with a digital agency and other Software Engineers working on new features for our website. 

With time I realised that programming interests me more than eCommerce. Thatâ€™s where my proper programming journey began combining my previous experience, and problem-solving skills gained working with a tricky CMS system. 

Now, I'm looking to change my career and fully focus on programming.


ðŸ”­ I have finished my first full-stack project in vanilla JS. 

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning REACT and Material UI by buildiing a Watchlist app to save and rate your favourite movies and shows.

ðŸ’¬ Ask me about baking sourdough bread.
