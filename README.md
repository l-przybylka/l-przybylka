### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I started my digital journey in eCommerce, where Iâ€™ve picked up the coding skills necessary for my job. Building simple newsletter emails and static pages. Iâ€™ve also gained experience working with a digital agency and other Software Engineers working on new features for our website. 

With time I realised that programming interests me more than eCommerce. Thatâ€™s where my proper programming journey began combining my previous experience, and problem-solving skills gained working with a tricky CMS system. 

Now, I'm looking to change my career and fully focus on programming.


ðŸ”­ I have finished my full-stack project in vanilla JS https://recipes-with-friends.onrender.com/. 

âš¡ I'm really interested in AI and in how it can improve our lives. I've been using ChatGPT to help me solve problems at my current role.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently buildiing a Watchlist app to save and rate your favourite movies and shows in REACT and Material UI.

ðŸ’¬ Ask me about baking sourdough bread.
