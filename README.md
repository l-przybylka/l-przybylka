### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I started my digital journey in eCommerce, where Iâ€™ve picked up the coding skills necessary for my job. Building simple newsletter emails and static pages. Iâ€™ve also gained experience working with a digital agency and other software engineers on new features for our website. 

With time I realised that programming interests me more than eCommerce. Thatâ€™s where my proper programming journey began combining my previous experience, and problem-solving skills gained working with a tricky CMS system. 

Now, I'm looking to change my career and entirely focus on programming.


ðŸ”­ See my most recent projects pinned below, you will find there a mixture of Infrastructure as Code in Terraform and Pulumi as well as front-end and full-stack projects. 

âš¡ I'm interested in AI and how it can improve our lives.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™ve worked on the MancJS meetup website using the TDD approach with jest as well as Next.js and TypeScript. https://github.com/BenSeward/mancjs

ðŸŒ± I'm currently learning and building cloud-related projects, my most recent one is written in Pulumi using TypeScript and OOP.

ðŸ’¬ Ask me about baking sourdough bread.
